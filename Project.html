<h1>Project</h1>
<div></div>

<a>My Idea is "Trade, Trade" </a>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This would be a website in which people who specialise in certain areas would put up which area they specialise in and would ask for someone to do something they specialise in a "Trade, Trade" this would mean people who don’t have much money or else like to save money would be able to. People would also be able to charge an amount if there’s nothing they can do in return. </p>
<h2>In Depth</h2>
<p>This service would be an app as well as a website that is free but would have non-intrusive apps on the right side and on the bottom. As well as having options for their ads to be "boosted" and be highlighted if they pay a small fee. This app would be great as most people who like saving money or have a lot of skills but not much money would be able to spend their money on more important things. This would be a huge thing as people love saving money and more personalised services. This app would also have reviews in order for high rated people to get the same high-quality job done. In a survey of 5 people who i asked 4/5 said they would use this app and website. </p>
<p>This project would be coded and designed by me then looked over by professionals in order to make sure it is all secure and legal. The app would go for a simplistic app style like uber, gumtree and other apps where ads are shown along with the person providing the service and their rating which would be based upon other people’s ratings. The app would also have legal agreements at the start to reduce responsibility if something bad does happen. Users would also need to verify their identity to reduce risks involved with people providing illegal services. </p>
<p>The software would be coded with python or Java; this project would be </p>
<h5>Skill required:</h5>
<p>The skills needed for this project would be, coding and security knowledge to ensure all parts of it are secure as a lot of personal details would be kept on servers. The program would require java knowledge so that would need to be learnt. The hardware needed would just be a few servers with good specifications like an HPE DL380 G9 2U Rack E5-2630v4 2.2Ghz 10-Core 16GB 8-Bay SFF P440AR 2GB 3YRS 848774-B21. This would ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. </p>
<p>If this project is successful it would mean that people would save a lot of money and the way that people get stuff done as well as people who do not have a job at the moment could do what they love and are skilled at which would help them to feel satisfied. It would also provide a good amount of money which means i'd be able to put more into refining it in order to make it a more professional service. </p>
<p>The reason i think this idea would be interesting and good to see how it goes is that if it did go well it would change so many peoples lives and create a better market for small businesses and big businesses to work together to save money and be able to find the best quality service. It would also generate revenue for me and help with other future projects i think of. </p>
<p>The main obstacles for me would be that its hard to learn Java aswell as do it properly in a manner that would mean it looks and feels smooth to move, This would require a lot of hours but this also means that if done well i would be able to do projects like this in the future. </p>
<p>I am passionate about projects like this as they would enable me to learn alot and make some money along the way. All together if i could create something that a lot of people use it would make me happy as i know i have done something for the world that was useful </p>
