<h4>Personal Information</h4>
<font color="black"><p>Hi,
My name is David Tabley and I am 19. I was born in sydney, I went to Warners Bay Highschool and completed
<br>year 12, I can speak some japanese that I learnt in high school but only remember how to say innapropriate words.
<br>I am from Newcastle in New South Wales, my hobbies include gaming and learning about technology.
<br>The games I mostly play are multiplayer ones with friends in which we normally just mess around and do not take it too serious,
<div></div>
<h4>Interests In IT</h4>
<br>My interests in information technology are mostly the hardware side of technology as in repairs like fixing broken motherboards and water damage.</p>
<p>My interest started when i was about 6 years old. It was when my brother first got a X-box and it always made me wonder how we got this far in technology for us to be able to have a gaming console. When I was about 15 I started getting into phone I first went from jailbreaking friends ones to fixing them, and although I did not fix the first few it was just a learning experience. When I was 17 I did work experience at a computer shop and from there I started learing everything at a exponential rate. My want to learn more lead me to RMIT</p>
